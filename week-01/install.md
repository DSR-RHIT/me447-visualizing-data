### Install R

*Mac and Linux users.*

-   From the Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](http://cran.us.r-project.org/), select *Download R for Linux* or *Download R for (Mac) OSX* and follow the instructions.

*Windows*

-   If you are a student or faculty member whose computer is maintained by an IT department, you will probably have a localmgr login account on your computer. If you do, you will have to login as the localmgr to install R and RStudio---it's not sufficient to have admin privileges on your usual login username. You must use localmgr.

-   If your computer is NOT maintained by an IT department, you can ignore the \`\`localmgr'' instructions and just login in the usual way.

-   From the Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) download the latest version of *R for Windows*. Look for the link labeled *Install R for the very first time*.

-   Install the software in *C:/Program Files*. Accept all defaults.
