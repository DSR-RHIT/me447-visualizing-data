#### Installing R & RStudio for Windows

I call these the "real" instructions because so many installation instructions I've encountered assume I know things that I don't know. Please let me know if these instructions fail you in any way. I'm always open to suggestions for improvement.

*localmgr login*

-   If you are a student or faculty member whose computer is maintained by an IT department, you will probably have a localmgr login account on your computer. If you do, you will have to login as the localmgr to install R and RStudio---it's not sufficient to have admin privileges on your usual login username. You must use localmgr.
-   If your computer is NOT maintained by an IT department, you can ignore the \`\`localmgr'' instructions and just login in the usual way.

*CRAN*

-   From the Comprehensive R Archive Network [(CRAN)](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) download the latest version of *R for Windows*. Look for the link labeled *Install R for the very first time*.
-   Install the software in *C:/Program Files*. Accept all defaults.
