### Install R

_Mac and Linux users._  

- From the Comprehensive R Archive Network  [(CRAN)](http://cran.us.r-project.org/), select _Download R for Linux_ or _Download R for (Mac) OSX_ and follow the instructions. 

_Windows_ 

- If you are a student or faculty member whose computer is maintained by an IT department, you will probably have a localmgr login account on your computer. If you do, you will have to login as the localmgr to install R and RStudio---it's not sufficient to have admin privileges on your usual login username. You must use localmgr. 

- If your computer is NOT maintained by an IT department, you can ignore the ``localmgr'' instructions and just login in the usual way. 

- From the Comprehensive R Archive Network  [(CRAN)](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) download the latest version of _R for Windows_. Look for the link labeled _Install R for the very first time_. 

- Install the software in _C:/Program Files_. Accept all defaults.
