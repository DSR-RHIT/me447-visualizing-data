### Set up an R project 

- Login with your usual user name. 

- Create a folder for the course in your preferred directory. For
example, C:/Users/layton/Documents/courses/me447. 

- Open RStudio. Some error statements will probably appear. No
worry. We’re about to take care of that. 

- Create a new RStudio Project using File menu > New Project > Existing Directory. Use the Browse button to find the course folder you just made. Select that folder > Create Project. 

### Create an .Renviron file 

These steps are Windows-specific (I'm not sure if the problem needs solving in Linux or Mac platforms.)

The purpose of the .Renviron file is to establish a library for R packages that is independent of the R software. Then you can update R to the latest version and not have to re-install all the packages you use.  

- In RStudio, open a new text file using File menu > New File >  Text
File. 

- Write the following line in the text file

    `R_LIBS_USER="C:/R/library"`

- Save the file using the filename .Renviron in your course folder
(don’t forget the dot that starts the filename). For example, C:/Users/layton/Documents/courses/me447/.Renviron 

- Create a new directory C:/R/library. (That is, in C: create a folder named R. In R create a folder named library.) This is the directory pointed to by the .Renviron file.

### For new RStudio projects 

- Whenever you create a new RStudio Project, paste a copy of the .Renviron file in the project root directory. 

### Testing your installation

- Close RStudio 

- Open RStudio. No error statements should appear (we hope). 

- If the course project is open, File > Close Project. No errors? 

- If the course project is closed, open it with File > Open Project. No
errors? 

- Now let’s see if the library path you made works. The RStudio interface is divided into 4 “window panes”. In the lower right pane, select the Packages tab. Click Install. 

- In the dialog box that appears, the Install to Library strip should indicate `C:/R/library [Default]`. 

- In the Packages entry box, type plyr and click Install. If all goes well, you’ll see something like this in the lower left pane (the “R Console”). 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
Installing package into "C:/R/library" 
(as "lib" is unspecified)

package "plyr" successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The downloaded binary packages are in
C:/Users/layton/AppData/Local/Temp/Rtmpwr9oHD/downloaded_packages

```

I find it convenient to have an RStudio shortcut on my desktop and to delete the shortcuts to R.
