### Testing your installation

- Close RStudio 

- Open RStudio. No error statements should appear (we hope). 

- If the course project is open, File > Close Project. No errors? 

- If the course project is closed, open it with File > Open Project. No
errors? 

- Now let’s see if the library path you made works. The RStudio interface is divided into 4 “window panes”. In the lower right pane, select the Packages tab. Click Install. 

- In the dialog box that appears, the Install to Library strip should indicate `C:/R/library [Default]`. 

- In the Packages entry box, type plyr and click Install. If all goes well, you’ll see something like this in the lower left pane (the “R Console”). 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
