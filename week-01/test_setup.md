### Testing your installation

-   Close RStudio

-   Open RStudio. No error statements should appear (we hope).

-   If the course project is open, File &gt; Close Project. No errors?

-   If the course project is closed, open it with File &gt; Open Project. No errors?

-   Now let’s see if the library path you made works. The RStudio interface is divided into 4 “window panes”. In the lower right pane, select the Packages tab. Click Install.

-   In the dialog box that appears, the Install to Library strip should indicate `C:/R/library [Default]`.

-   In the Packages entry box, type plyr and click Install. If all goes well, you’ll see something like this in the lower left pane (the “R Console”).

``` r
