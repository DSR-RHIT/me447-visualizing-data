visual rhetoric and R graphics for the R novice
-----------------------------------------------

The course is about creating truthful and compelling data visuals. We study elements of statistical analysis, programming in R, human perception, graphic design, and visual rhetoric and ethics. After successfully completing this course, students should be able to design effective and truthful data displays, credibly explain their design rationale, produce publication-quality visuals, and credibly critique a data display. Prior experience with R is not required.
