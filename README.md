Visual rhetoric and R graphics

The course is about creating truthful and compelling data visuals. We study elements of statistical analysis, programming in R, human perception, graphic design, and visual rhetoric and ethics. After successfully completing this course, students should be able to design effective and truthful data displays, credibly explain their design rationale, produce publication-quality visuals, and credibly critique a data display. Prior experience with R is not required.

#### getting started

It is helpful if everyone installs the software before the first day of class so we can quickly discover any issues you might be having. Instuctions for installing R and RStudio and setting up your first R Project directory are [here](https://github.com/DSR-RHIT/install-R-and-RStudio).
