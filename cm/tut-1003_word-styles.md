tools for Rmd to docx
---------------------

As you've seen, you can work reproducibly with Rmd scripts to produce documents in docx format. Often, this is the only format acceptable to your collaborators.

What we haven't looked at yet is how to use Word styles reproducibly for *document design.* The methods in the articles below will get you started.

If you find additional methods, or develop tricks of your own, let me know and I'll add them to the list.
