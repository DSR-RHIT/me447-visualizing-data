# installing software

We begin by installing R and RStudio  on your local machine. 

- [Install R & RStudio](cm502_install-r-rstudio.md)

Next we install git locally for version control and collaboration. 

- [Install git](cm503_install-git.md)

And finally we create a local library for R packages. 

- [Create library](cm504_library.md)

Please complete these tasks before our first lab period.
