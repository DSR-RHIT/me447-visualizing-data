adding prose to your portfolio
------------------------------

Most of your prose will be in plain text in the .Rmd script.

-   To the portfolio .Rmd script, write your critique in plain text.
-   Use markup tags for heading levels, emphasis, etc.
-   Knit HTML (or Word) to check that everything works as expected.

For drafting stages I prefer HTML output. Later we will cover how to manage Word Styles to customize the design of Word output documents.
