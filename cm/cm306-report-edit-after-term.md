the portfolio after the term
================

## editing before publications

At the end of the term, if you decide to make your portfolio public, you
may wish to

  - Delete the links to the reading and presentation discussions
  - Edit the README for a personalized layout
  - Edit the links to the displays to include only those you wish to
    showcase
  - Edit the portfolio to remove the D1, D2, etc designations that are
    there for my convenience
  - Edit the reports to remove the data and display requirements lists
    that are there for my convenience

Please wait to do any editing until after grades are turned in.
