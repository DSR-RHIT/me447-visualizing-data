## setup GitHub

GitHub is a hosting service that provides an online home for your
Git-based projectsâ€”critically important for sharing with
collaborators. Once you have a GitHub account, you will update your
repositories using the RStudio interface.

Optional reading: Read section 4 of [Excuse me, do you have a moment to
talk about version
control?](https://dx.doi.org/10.7287%2Fpeerj.preprints.3159v2) for a
good introduction to GitHub repositories.

#### obtain an account

  - [Join GitHub
    Education](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#free-private-repos)
    Follow the links to join GitHub Education â€” itâ€™s free.

#### setup

Jenny Bryan provided the instructions below for a workshop I attended. I
suggest you read the full instructions for one of the steps before doing
that step.

Some instructions ask you to type commands in the â€œshellâ€. To access
the shell, open RStudio and use the pulldown menu *Tools \> Shell*.

  - [Introduce yourself to
    Git](http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html#hello-git) using the
    name and email you used with your GitHub account
  - [Cache your username and
    password](http://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#credential-caching)
    or so you donâ€™t need to authenticate yourself to GitHub
    interactively ad nauseum. Alternatively, you can [set up SSH
    keys](http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys).  
  - [Prove RStudio can find local
    Git](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html#rstudio-git-github)
    and, therefore, can talk to GitHub

#### clean up

Once everything is working OK, you may delete any temporary test repos
you made.

  - Delete the local test project directories
  - Navigate to the repo on GitHub and go to *Settings \> Danger Zone \>
    Delete this repository*
