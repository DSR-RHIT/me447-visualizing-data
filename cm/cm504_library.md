# create a library for packages

Packages are like “apps” for R. As Hadley states, “Packages are the
fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable
functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample
data.”

If we store packages in a library separate from the base R installation,
then when you update R, you don’t have to reinstall every package,
saving a lot of time.

## assignment

At the top level of your drive, create a new directory (folder) named
“R”. In that directory create a new folder named “library”, for
example,

  - Windows: `C:/R/library`
  - Linux: `~/R/library`
