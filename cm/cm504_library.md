# create a library for packages

Packages are like “apps” for R. As Hadley Wickham
([2014](#ref-Wickham2014AdvR)) states, “Packages are the fundamental
units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, the
documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.”

If we store packages in a library separate from the base R installation,
then when you update R, you don’t have to reinstall every package,
saving a lot of time.

At the top level of your drive, create a new directory (folder) named
“R”. In that directory create a new folder named “library”, for
example,

  - Windows: `C:/R/library`
  - Linux: `~/R/library`
