## media

Your portfolio is a website in the form of a GitHub repository. The repo
is private, accessible only to people you invite as collaborators.
However, your intended audience are your professional peers and
prospective employers.

[This sample](https://github.com/graphdr/portfolio-sample) shows the
basic layout of the portfolio website we are about to start building.

## organize the README file

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

The README file is the main page of the website. README introduces the
reader to your portfolio and provides navigation links to your
individual display reports. The introduction and display reports are the
the main elements of a portfolio that you might eventually make public.

The responses to the prompts are essentially research material you use
to write the reports and that I use to assess your progress.

> Write instructions to begin editing the README. Section headings and a
> link to the first report. Some suggestions for editing the
> Introduction.

## importing images

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

> Instructions on saving any image to the resources folder. Then as an
> example, import to the README page as a placeholder.

## start a report

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

One Rmd report is written per display. Each report describes the data,
the graph design, and elements of visual rhetoric relevant to the story.

> Instructions for creating the first report template, `reports/d1.Rmd`.
> Push to github and test the link from README to the report.

## data tables

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

> In the sample report, show how to create a sample data table.
> Typically wide. Brief introduction to principles from Stephen few on
> table layout—adapted to the GitHub environment.

## citations and references

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

> Set up a .bib file with a sample reference and citation style. In the
> draft report, show how to add a citation.

## presentation prompts

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

Complete the prompts before the start of class on the day of the
presentation.

  - These points guide the small-group discussions.
  - Much of this work will be part of your portfolio critiques.

## reading prompts

All work is performed within RStudio with your `portfolio.Rproj` file
open.

Complete the prompts before the start of class on the day of the reading
discussion.

Visual design and rhetorical decisions are expected to be supported by
evidence from our readings.
