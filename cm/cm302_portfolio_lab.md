## media

Your portfolio is a website in the form of a GitHub repository. The repo
is private, accessible only to people you invite as collaborators.
However, I expect you to treat these pages as if you intended to make
them available to a prospective employer.

[This sample](https://github.com/graphdr/portfolio-sample) shows the
basic layout of the portfolio website we are about to start building.

## readme

The README file introduces the reader to your portfolio and provides
links to individual reports and other material.
