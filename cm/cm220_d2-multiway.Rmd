## D2 multiway 

The distinguishing characteristic of multiway data is that there is a quantitative value associated with every combination of levels of two categorical variables. 

Graph both the original multiway and its dual (swapping rows and panels). Include only one of these graphs in your portfolio. Select the design that best conveys the stories in your data.
