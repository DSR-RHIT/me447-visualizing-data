## media 

Your portfolio is a website in the form of a GitHub repository. The repo is private, accessible only to people you invite as collaborators. However, I expect you to treat these pages as if you intended to make them available to a prospective employer. 

[This sample](https://github.com/graphdr/portfolio-sample) shows the basic layout of the portfolio website we are about to start building.  


## readme 

The README file introduces the reader to your portfolio and provides links to individual reports and other material.
