## D1 distributions

Univariate data are measurements of a single quantitative variable. The
data can be separated into groups by a categorical variable, creating
one distribution for each level of the category for comparison.

We will use three display types for comparing distributions

  - histograms
  - density plots
  - box plots

Using the same data, I suggest you create drafts of all three types and
include in the portfolio only the one that best conveys the stories in
the data.

## data

Data for these graphs are univariate with at least 200 values total.

These data must also include at least one categorical variable to sort
the data into at least three groups for comparison.

  - If one category is used, it must have at least three levels for a
    minimum of three comparisons.  
  - If two categories are used, they must have at least two levels each
    for a minmum of four comparisons.
