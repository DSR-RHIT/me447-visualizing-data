## D1 distributions

Univariate data are measurements of a single quantitative variable. The
data can be separated into groups by a categorical variable, creating
one distribution for each level of the category for comparison.

We will use three prospective graph designs for comparing distributions

  - histograms
  - density plots
  - box plots

Include only one of these graph types in your portfolio. Select the
design that best conveys the stories in your data.
