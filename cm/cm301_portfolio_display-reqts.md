# portfolio display requirements

The table summarizes the basic data structure for all portfolio
graphs.  
Specific data requirements are provided
below.

<!-- Quantitative variables are typically continuous. If you encounter a quantitative variable (other than time) that is discrete rather than continuous, please consult with me on its suitability for your graph.   -->

## D1 distributions

Univariate data are measurements of a single quantitative variable. The
data can be separated into groups by a categorical variable, creating
one distribution for each level of the category for comparison.

We will use three prospective graph designs for comparing distributions.
Include only one of these graph types in your portfolio. Select the
design that best conveys the stories in your data.

  - histograms
  - density plots
  - box plots

Data requirements

  - Minimum 200 observations of one quantitative variable  
  - One or two categorical variables  
  - No time-series

Categorical variables

  - If one category is used, it must have at least three levels for a
    minimum of three comparisons.  
  - If two categories are used, they must have at least two levels each
    for a minmum of four comparisons.
