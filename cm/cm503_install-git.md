# install git

Git is version control software you install on your machine. Once
installed, we will access its functionality via the RStudio interface.

  - [Why Git? What is
    Git?](../resources/readings/2017-Bryan-Version-control) Read
    sections 1 and 2 for a good introduction to version control

Jenny Bryan provided these instructions for a workshop I attended. I
suggest you read all the instructions before starting.

  - [Git already
    installed?](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#git-already-installed)
  - [Windows](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
    install
  - [Mac OS](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#mac-os) install
  - [Linux](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#linux) install

That’s all for now. We’ll do more with git when we work with GitHub.
