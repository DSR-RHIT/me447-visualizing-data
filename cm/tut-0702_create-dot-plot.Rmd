## create a dot plot 

The dot plot can be used to replace any data graphic typically drawn as a pie chart or a bar chart. The data structure is typically 

- a continuous quantitative variable (such as mpg) associated with 
- a categorical variable with a number of levels (such as the car make and model) 
 
 The data frame *my_mtcars* was created in the previous tutorial. 
 
 Here we graph the car make and model as a function of mileage in mpg. 
 
```{r}
# make basic dot plot
library(ggplot2)
f1 <- ggplot(data = my_mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = make_model)) +
	geom_point()
print(f1)
```
