reference books
---------------

-   [*R in Action, 2/e*](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition) by Robert Kabacoff, 2015, Manning Publications. If you want to buy just one good reference for R, this is the one I recommend. It covers R basics including statistical analysis and graphics.
-   [*R Graphics, 2/e*](https://www.crcpress.com/R-Graphics-Second-Edition/Murrell/p/book/9781439831762) by Paul Murrell, 2011, CRC Press. This is the book for learning about the four major R graphics systems (`base, grid, lattice, ggplot2`). The author's [book website](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/RG2e/) has the code for every figure in the book.
