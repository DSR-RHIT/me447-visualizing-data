# test initial installation 

Here we perform some simple checks to determine if the initial software installation is successful. If the test is unsuccessful, don't panic---we'll have some time in lab to make things work. 

- Launch RStudio 

A window should open that looks something like this. 

```{r}
include_graphics("../resources/images/open-rstudio.png")
```

You can type R code in the Console pane, and press Enter to run it. For example, 

- in the Console type `2 + 7`  
- press Enter to obtain the result 

```{r}
2 + 7
```

We can draw a simple graph that should appear in the Plots pane. 

- one line at a time, type the following lines and press Enter    

```{r echo = TRUE, out.width = "50%"}
t <- seq(1, 6*pi, pi/16)
y <- sin(t)
plot(t, y)
```

Lastly, let's check if RStudio can see git locally. In RStudio, 

- Tools > Terminal > Move Focus To Terminal  
- In the terminal pane, type  

```
git --version 
```

If RStudio is aware of your git installation, you should see a response in the terminal something like this 

```
git version 2.17.0.windows.1
```

If not, no worries. We'll take care of it in lab.
