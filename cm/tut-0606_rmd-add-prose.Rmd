## adding prose to your portfolio

Most of your prose will be in plain text in the .Rmd script. 

- To the portfolio .Rmd script, write your critique in plain text. 
- Use markup tags for heading levels, emphasis, etc. 
- Knit HTML (or Word) to check that everything works as expected. 

For  drafting stages I prefer HTML output. Later we will cover how to manage Word Styles to customize the design of Word output documents.
