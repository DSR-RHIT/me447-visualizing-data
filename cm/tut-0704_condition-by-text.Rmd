## condition a dot plot with text

To replace the dot with text, we select a variable in the data frame that has the text we want. 

Here, we'll use *cyl*, the variable that has the number of cylinders in the engine of each car. 

```{r}
# recall that cyl is in the data frame
glimpse(my_mtcars)
```

We use *geom_text* and `label = cyl` in the aesthetics.

```{r}
# could use the number of cylinders as the data marker
f4 <- ggplot(data = my_mtcars
	, aes(x = mpg, y = reorder(make_model, mpg), label = cyl)
	) +
	geom_text()
print(f4)
```
