## q-q plot

The quantile-quantile (q-q) plot is a graphical technique for
determining if two groups of data come from populations with a common
distribution. Data requirements:

  - Two samples of one quantitative variable, min. 200 observations
    total.
  - One categorical variable that defines the two groups (two levels
    only)
  - The sample sizes of the two groups do not need to be equal

For additional technical details, see (Quantile-quantile plot,
[2018](#ref-nist-q-q)).

## diverging stacked bar

Diverging stacked bar charts are the primary graphical display technique
for reporting survey data. Respondents are typically asked to choose one
response from a discrete number of options such as Strongly Disagree,
Disagree, No Opinion, Agree, Strongly Agree.

For additional technical details, see Heiberger & Robbins
([2014](#ref-HeibergerRobbins2014)).
