## we usually interact with R using scripts

Start by opening your RStudio project:<br> 
File $\rightarrow$ Recent projects $\rightarrow$ me447_visualizing-data.Rproj.

> ALWAYS start your work session by launching the .Rproj file you created for this course 

A script is a file of R commands. To start a new R script, use<br>
File $\rightarrow$ New File $\rightarrow$ R Script.

![](../images/panes-4.png)

Save the script in the *practiceR* folder using the filename *tut01_first-script.R*<br>

File $\rightarrow$ Save As... $\rightarrow$ *tut01_first-script.R*

My suggested file naming for tutorials 

- starts with *tut* indicating a tutorial  
- follows with with *01* indicating chronological order in which the tutorials are assigned 
- concludes with *first-script* indicating the topic 

The open R-script file is shown in the Source pane. This is where
we write, edit, and execute R scripts.

Start your script with at least a minimal header, such as

```
# tut01_first-script
# your name
# date
```

As you work through the exercises below, add your lines of code
to this file.

If you wish to start a program by clearing all variables from the
workspace, use `rm()`.

```{r}
# clear variables from workspace
rm(list = ls())
```

Execute the file (run the program) by clicking the *Source* button.
The Environment pane should now be empty.

In your script, create an array $x_1 = \{1, 2, ..., 10\}$ using the `seq()` function.

```{r}
# create an array 0, 1, 2, ..., 10
x1 <- seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1)
```

In a function, arguments are assigned values in an `argument = value`
format. Using the equal sign in this way is conventional R syntax.

Again, press Source to execute the file. The variable $x_1$ should
appear in the Environment pane.

When debugging scripts it is often useful to execute just one line of
code at a time.

- In the script, place your cursor on the line with `rm(list=ls())`.
- Press the Run button to execute the line.
- The Environment pane should now be empty.

In the Source pane, the cursor should have advanced to the next
line. Press Run again and the variable $x_1$ should reappear.

To summarize our two methods of executing lines of script: 

1. *Run* to execute one line at a time.
2. *Source* to execute an entire script.

Add to your script $sin(x_1)$ assigned to variable $y_1$.

```{r}
# create a second array that is a function of the first
y1 <- sin(x1)
```

Graph it.

```{r cm012_sine-curve}
# plot y1 as a function of x1
plot(x1, y1)
```

Click Source and the graph should appear in the Plots pane.

For more information on any of these functions in R, see the links I've provided on the [Getting help](cm/admin-04_getting-help.md) page.
