An exceptional portfolio showcases your ability to communicate truthful
and compelling stories using quantitative data and effective visual
rhetoric. My goal is to help you craft a document that you would be
proud to include in your employment portfolio.

All coursework is directed towards completing a portfolio that
demonstrates the degree to which you can:

  - Design effective and truthful data displays.
  - Credibly explain your design rationale.
  - Produce publication-quality visuals.
  - Credibly critique a data display.

## displays

Seven displays (D1–D7) are required. Follow the links for details of the
required data structures.

  - [D1 distributions](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D1-distributions)
  - [D2 multiway](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D2-multiway)
  - [D3 correlations](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D3-correlations)
  - [D4 injuries or
    fatalities](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D4-injuries-or-fatalities)
  - [D5 redesign a graphical
    lie](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D5-redesign-a-graphical-lie)
  - [D6 multivariate](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D6-multivariate)
  - [D7 self-taught](cm301-report-display-reqts.md#D7-self-taught)

A display can meet more than one requirement. For example, a D3
correlation graph can also meet the technical discipline requirement.

Students sometimes exceed the minimum number of displays to meet all the
requirements, to explore data they find interesting, or to showcase
something they’ve learned on their own.

## critiques

A written critique is required for every display.

Effective critiques are well-reasoned and well-informed. In our
round-table critiques, you share and refine your reasoning; in our
readings and discussions, you find a basis for an informed opinion.

  - introduce the display so the reader knows what they are seeing  
  - describe the type of story being told
  - describe the data structure  
  - explain how the graph design is appropriate to the data structure  
  - explain your rationale for important design elements
  - use the comments from the presentation prompts to discuss elements
    of the graph design

## citing sources

The credibility of your critique is supported by the credibility and
relevance of your citations.

Avoid the novice practice of sprinkling citations like confetti at New
Year’s to make an argument *appear* supported. Instead, construct your
argument first—say what you are trying to say—based on the stuff you’re
learning. That stuff is based on credible sources. Cite those sources.

We will use the author-date citation style and automate the generation
of formatted citations and references using R Markdown.

Each display in your portfolio will have its own page in your portfolio,
so each will conclude with its own set of references.

## revising

First drafts ![\\neq](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cneq
"\\neq") final drafts. Plan to pre-write (elements of your argument),
draft (it wonâ€™t be pretty but get it down), revise (writing is
rewriting), edit (to polish), and check (facts and sources must be
correct).

Drafting, revising, editing, and checking apply to the data displays as
well as the critiques.

As your knowledge and ability develop over the term, you may find that
displays you created in the first few weeks no longer meet your
developing standards of excellence. You may come across more interesting
data or more compelling stories and decide to replace an earlier display
with a new one.

That’s all to be expected with our goal of crafting a showcase document.

## technical discipline

Two of your displays must use data relevant to problems in your
technical area. You might consider:

  - Redesigning a poorly designed graph from a journal or conference
    proceedings in your technical area.
  - Using data from any research you have been involved with.
  - Obtaining data from a Rose faculty member who needs help with data
    graphics.
  - If you are a member of a team in another class or project you may
    act as a graph consultant for that team, creating data displays that
    contribute to the teams’ work as well as your portfolio. Your
    teammates might resist however—avoid pressuring them to use your
    work.

## sports data limit

Because our goal is to create a portfolio of data displays suitable for
an audience of your professional peers and prospective employers, I
impose a limit on the number of sports-related data.

No more than two of your displays can be related to sport.

## redesigns

A **redesign** is where you start with someone else’s published graph,
use their data, and redesign the display tell a more truthful or
compelling story.

Redesigns often include: changing the display type, e.g., from a pie
chart to a dot plot; adding information, such as extending a time series
to include more data; or correcting a lie, such as converting nominal
dollars to constant dollars.

The only required redesign is D5, Redesigning a graphical lie. Other
displays in your portfolio can be redesigns as long as the data
structure satisfies the display requirements.

The portfolio must include an image of the original graph with a
critique of its deficiencies. The critique of the redesign should
discuss the rationale underlying your improvements.

## reproductions

A maximum of 2 displays can be reproductions: designs you have copied
from someone else. (The “someone else” may not be current or past
Rose-Hulman faculty, staff, or students.) Reproductions come in two
flavors: imitate the design and recreate the graph.

**Imitate the design**

  - Use someone’s design as a guide with a completely different set of
    variables.
  - Adapting their R code to your design is permitted.
  - Revise the reproduction to correct any major deficiencies.
  - Display requirements must still be met.

**Recreate a graph**

  - Recreate a graph as published but for which no R code is available.
  - Write original code to recreate the display.  
  - Revise the reproduction to correct any major deficiencies.
  - Display requirements must still be met.

The portfolio must include an image of the original graph with a
critique of any deficiencies. The critique of the reproduction should
discuss the rationale underlying any improvements.

## a compelling story

At least one display must tell a compelling story, that is, a story that
compels an audience to action.

To compel an audience to action, a display must tell an important story
based on complete and credible data and some insights into the story’s
context. You will encounter several such displays during the term:
examples to inspire your work. This isn’t easy, so only one is required.
(A reproduction, even if compelling, does not satisfy this requirement.)

## 500-level course

Students enrolled in the 500-level course must also use data from their
project or thesis research to develop additional displays:

1.  Three different types of exploratory displays for the same data,
    with critiques
2.  A final display suitable for publication in their thesis or project
    report, with critique\#\# 500-level course
