## D6 multivariate

We use the term *multivariate* for data comprising 3 or more
quantitative variables per observation.

Multivariate data, unlike univariate and bivariate data, are difficult
to visualize in two-dimensional media. In the special case of
three-dimensional (trivariate) data, we can sometimes use perspective to
visualize relationships, though not always effectively.

We use three graph designs for exploring multivariate data.

  - conditioning plot
  - scatterplot matrix
  - parallel coordinate plot

Include only one of these graph types in your portfolio. Select the
design that best conveys the stories in your data.

## data

Requirements

  - minimum 20 observations
  - three or more quantitative variables  
  - time-series data are excluded
  - no categorical variables

Use a conditioning plot (coplot) for three or four variables.

For four or more variables, use a scatterplot matrix or a parallel
coordinate plot.
