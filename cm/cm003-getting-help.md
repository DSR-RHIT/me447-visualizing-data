## books I recommend

  - [*R in
    Action, 2/e*](https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-second-edition)
    by Robert Kabacoff, 2015, Manning Publications. If you want to buy
    just one good reference for R, this is the one I recommend. It
    covers R basics including statistical analysis and graphics.
  - [*Data Visualization*](https://socviz.co/) by Kieran Healy, 2018,
    Princeton University Press. Covers many of the design principles and
    graph types we use in the course.
