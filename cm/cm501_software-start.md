# start installing software

Please complete these tasks before our first lab period.

We begin by installing R and RStudio on your local machine.

  - [Install R & RStudio](cm502_install-r-rstudio.md)

Next we install git locally for version control and collaboration.

  - [Install git](cm503_install-git.md)

And finally we create a local library for R packages.

  - [Create library](cm504_library.md)

Finally, we test to see if the basic installation is successful.

  - [Test the initial installation](cm505_test-initial-install.md)
