## notes

1.  *Quantitative variables are typically continuous*. If you encounter
    a quantitative variable (other than time) that is discrete rather
    than continuous, please consult with me on its suitability.

2.  *Is a categorical variable ordered?* The order in which the levels
    of a category are presented depends on whether or not the category
    is ordered or not.

3.  *Some categorical variables are potentially optional*. A category
    marked “optional” indicates that the graph may or may not have a
    categorical variable whose levels are used as a conditioning
    variable.
