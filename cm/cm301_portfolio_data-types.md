# portfolio data summary

Generally, different displays in the portfolio have different structures
with different numbers of quantitative and categorical variables. The
basic data structure for all graphs in the portfolio are summarized in
the table.

Quantitative variables are typically continuous. If you encounter a
quantitative variable (other than time) that is discrete rather than
continuous, please consult with me on its suitability for your
graph.
