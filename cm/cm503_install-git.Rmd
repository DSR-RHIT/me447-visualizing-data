# install git

Git is version control software you install on your machine. Once installed, we will access its functionality via the RStudio interface.  

- [Why Git? What is Git?](../resources/readings/2017-Bryan-Version-control) Read sections 1 and 2 for a good introduction to version control 

Jenny Bryan provided these instructions for a workshop I attended. I suggest you read all the instructions before starting.
