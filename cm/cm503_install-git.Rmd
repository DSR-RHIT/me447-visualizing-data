# install git

Git is version control software you install on your machine. Once installed, we access its functionality via the RStudio interface. Jenny Bryan provided these installation instructions for a workshop I attended. I suggest you read all the instructions before starting. 

- [Git already installed?](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#git-already-installed) 
- [Windows](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows) install 
- [Mac OS](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#mac-os) install 
- [Linux](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#linux) install 


Optional reading: If you are interested in why version control is important, read sections 1 and 2 of the following article by Jenny Bryan, [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://dx.doi.org/10.7287%2Fpeerj.preprints.3159v2)
